Why does people so desperatly wants attention? I see in everywhere, but especially on social media. Maybe it's the feed back and seratonin that comes with that. Or maybe it's knowing that somebody is out there and cares about you. But you know what I think of. 
I think none of that is the reason.

We want to believe that we are unique and special. We want to believe that 'cause otherwise.. Well otherwise, what you are?

And on social media people show themselves. Shares a pictures, videos, snaps, stories. It's like the evidences of their uniqueness. But it's always same thing. They follows certain trends. The angle of the photos is almost the same. They are trying to be special but over time they are getting more like each other. 

Because in todays world if you want to get an attention you have to follow the rules. Only way to feel unique is being the same as others. Our culture has made us all the same. We all want the same thing. One by one, none of us are anything.
