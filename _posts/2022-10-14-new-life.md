Wow, I'm working now. I teach coding to teens and children. It's kinda exciting but it's also kinda boring and lame. 

Don't get me wrong though. I love teaching but working for money. Especially working for a little amount of money... Nah bruh. Not for me.

Almost at every class, there are 9-11 students and I get just an amount of the one student pays. So it's like charity work. %90 of the money I make goes to the company that I work for.

Thinking about the old days brings tons of memory. I remember that I wanted to be a successful person. Then I learned success is just a form of a approval from society. And I don't need that. 

I have 3 housemates right now. There are lots of benefits to having housemates but also there are drawbacks. For example, using 16mpbs internet with 4 people is almost impossible. But cost of the bills are also divided by 4 so it's kinda good.

Let's work hard and see the results of hard work. I think good things will happen soon.
